# Wikidata:Wordle

[Wikidata:Wordle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Wordle) is a puzzle game inspired by the original [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)  
and by community-driven experiments such as [Ordia Game](https://ordia.toolforge.org/game/),  
[Talaios Wordle](https://wordle.talaios.coop/), and [Gene of the Day](https://geneofthe.day/).

Unlike traditional Wordle clones, my experiment uses **Wikidata Lexemes** as its word source.  
Players guess missing letters in lexemes, supported by hints:  
- Grammatical features (noun, gender, plural form)  
- Associated images from Wikimedia Commons  
- Pronunciation audio (if available)  
- Translations and senses  

This project combines the fun of Wordle with the educational power of Wikidata’s lexicographic data.
